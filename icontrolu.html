		<h2>About iControlU</h2>
		iControlU is a popular Minecraft trolling plugin which aims to add mind control to your Spigot server! With just one simple command, you and your admin can take control of other online players and override their <b>movements, commands, chat messages, inventories, damage, and more!</b> While you are in Control Mode, victim players are affected in real-time and are given the unsolicited privilege of watching your troll take place in a first- or third-person perspective. Your movements become their movements with little-to-no delay and look authentic to other players thanks to <b>LibsDisguises</b>. iControlU was designed to be easy to use, fun, and totally addicting.. iControlU is perfect for trolling hackers and friends, showing new players around your server, and everything in-between. See what all the buzz is about and download iControlU today on SpigotMC.org!

		<h2>Using iControlU</h2>
		To install iControlU, simply drag the downloaded file "iControlU.jar" into your server's <b>/plugins</b> folder and restart the server. iControlU depends on <b>LibsDisguises</b> and <b>ProtocolLib</b> to run, so you'll need to install these as well. Download links to all of iControlU's dependencies are available in the Update Notes.
		<br>
		To use the plugin, simply run <b>/icu</b> to see a list of available commands. Some commands require a permission node, while others are accessible by everybody. See SpigotMC for more details on commands and permissions. iControlU includes several optional crafting recipes for items such as the <b>Reduction Helmet and Amplifying Helmet</b>, and includes several great customizable options.
