		<br>
		<br>
		Ahoy!
		<br>
		Welcome to the Developer Log, otherwise known as the Captain's Log - a site dedicated to news, rants, useless stories, and activism.
		I am the developer, the captain of this fine vessel, <b>FireBreath15</b>. Throughout the voyage of this captain's log, I plan to write
		on anything and everything that I think the Internet is interested in. Don't worry, I'll spare you everything else. In any case, this
		page will be full of news about myself and my software, rants about anything in the community or in the country that I think should be
		addressed, useless stories of awesomeness that are extremely worthwhile, and activism for whatever I'm feeling like at the moment.
		<br>
		<br>
		I hope to see the site grow, as well as the 'Log, so please let me know your thoughts!
		<br>
		Signing off,
		<br>
