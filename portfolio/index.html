        <p>Welcome to my Portfolio! Below are some of my favorite projects, both completed and still in-progress. See
        the panels below for more information!</p>

        <div class="deepblue portfolio">
            <img src="../assets/img/portfolio/logo_icontrolu.png" alt="iControlU Logo"/>
            <p><strong>Take control of your players. Literally!</strong> iControlU is one of my most popular projects, boasting
            more than 360,000 total downloads as of 2017. Taking control of other players and using their own identities
                against them has never been easier! The latest version retails on Spigot and can be downloaded <a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/.20034/" target="_blank">on this page.</a>
                Older versions of the plugin can be found for free on Bukkit <a href="https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/icontrolu" target="_blank">on this page.</a></p>

        <div class="creepergreen portfolio">
            <img src="../assets/img/portfolio/logo_nanobots.png" alt="Nanobots Logo"/>
            <p>Nanobots is my first collaboration project, in which its concept was created by myself and a few of my friends.
                This plugin enables players to craft <strong>Nanoblocks</strong>. These dastardly creations can devour specific blocks,
                or eat through just about everything in their place. Explore Grey Goo on your server today! Nanobots can be
                downloaded for free on Spigot <a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/.28511/" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
        </div>

        <div class="portfolio">
            <img src="../assets/img/portfolio/logo_thegrid.png" alt="The Grid Logo"/>
            <p>One of my favorite ongoing projects, this plugin provides a
                server-wide and open-world hacking adventure that is not only easy to install, but it is efficient and powerful.
                In this game mode, players can "hack" enemy NPC computers and other users to gain experience, in-game currency,
                and more. <a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/.35246/" target="_blank">Check it out</a> on Spigot!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="creepergreen portfolio">
            <img src="../assets/img/portfolio/logo_ghostblocks.jpg" alt="Ghostblocks Logo"/>
            <p><em>Who ya gonna call?</em> Introducing Ghostblocks: a simple mechanic that adds a unique twist to any server! These
                are not only easy to craft, use, and manage, but are efficient and highly customizable. Create disappearing blocks
                to hide your secret base, trick your friends, or add a sense of adventure to your server.

        <div class="blue portfolio">
            <img src="../assets/img/portfolio/logo_yotsuba.png" alt="Yotsuba Logo"/>
            <p>Standing as the pinnacle of society is the Yotsuba Group from Tsugumi Ohba's series <em>Death Note</em>.
            Correlated closely to <a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/.43968/" target="_blank">my plugin</a> with a similar name, this
            fan-made website was another collaboration between some friends and I. Aiming to be a realistic representation of the
            fictional company, <a href="http://yotsuba.group" target="_blank">this website</a> is a work-in-progress.
