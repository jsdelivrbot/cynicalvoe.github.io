        <p>Welcome to my Portfolio! Below are some of my favorite projects, both completed and still in-progress. See
        the panels below for more information!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tripanelContent">
        <div class="deepblue tripanelItem">
            <img src="../assets/img/portfolio/logo_icontrolu.png" alt="iControlU Logo"/>
            <p><strong>Take control of your players. Literally!</strong> <br/>
                Boasting more than 360,000 total downloads since release, iControlU is my most popular project. Taking
                control of other Minecraft players and using their own identities against them has never been easier! Override their
                chats, movements, inventory, commands, health, and more with just a few clicks. The latest version
                retails on Spigot and can be downloaded <a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/.20034/" target="_blank">on this page.</a>
                Older versions of the plugin can be found for free on Bukkit <a href="https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/icontrolu" target="_blank">on this page.</a></p>
        </div>

        <div class="creepergreen tripanelItem">
            <img src="../assets/img/portfolio/logo_aperture.png" alt="Aperture Logo"/>
            <p><strong>Real-working cameras!</strong> <br/>
                Aperture allows players to create real-working CCTV cameras in Minecraft. Unlike similar plugins, which
                simply teleport the player to the camera's location, Aperture displays the camera's footage to the player
                wherever they are. More than just streaming blocks, Aperture also displays mobs and players in the camera
                footage as well! Grab yourself a camera and <a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/.50364/">check out Aperture</a>!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="blue tripanelItem">
            <img src="../assets/img/portfolio/logo_bitscrambler.ico" alt="Bitscrambler Logo"/>
            <p><strong>Protect your data!</strong> <br/>
                Bitscrambler is a lightweight file encryption program that I originally developed for private use, but
                eventually put it up online for others to use as well. The C# project can encrypt multiple files in
                parallel, and uses the strong AES256 algorithm behind the scenes. You can view the source code or
                download a copy for yourself over <a href="https://github.com/xFyreWolfx/BitScrambler">at GitHub</a>.</p>

        <div class="creepergreen tripanelItem">
            <img src="../assets/img/portfolio/logo_thegrid.png" alt="The Grid Logo"/>
            <p><strong>A hacking RPG engine!</strong> <br/>
                Everybody's connected. Everyone's vulnerable. The Grid is a Minecraft computer hacking simulator, where
                players can attack vulnerable systems. And each other. Harness the power of your laptop and the
                viruses you own, and gain XP as you grow your skills. The Grid is easy to configure, efficient to run, and
                powerful to use.<a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/.35246/" target="_blank">Check it out</a>
                for free on Spigot!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="deepblue tripanelItem">
            <img src="../assets/img/portfolio/logo_nanobots.png" alt="Nanobots Logo"/>
            <p><strong>Matter-eating nanobots!</strong> <br/>
                Craft <strong>Nanoblocks</strong> - block-harvesting Gray Goo. These dastardly creations can devour
                specific blocks, generating iron ingots in the process. Now, you can have an unlimited supply of iron.
                The catch? These blocks can eat through just about everything in their place. One wrong move, and your
                iron farm will eat everything you own! Nanobots can be downloaded for free on Spigot
                <a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/.28511/" target="_blank">here.</a></p>

            <p><strong>This website!</strong> <br/>
                While I'm not the best web developer, this website was built from scratch using what I've learned
                over the years. I chose not to use technologies like MVC or Node.js just to keep things simple, but
                I also have some experience with these as well.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="panel">
            <h1 class="pageTitle">Skills</h1>
            <p>I have experience in <strong id="orn">HTML5</strong>, <strong id="grn">CSS3</strong>, <strong id="dorn">JavaScript</strong> /
                <strong id="blu">JSON, XML, YAML & jQuery</strong>, <strong id="lgrn">Python</strong>, <strong id="pur">Java</strong>,
                <strong id="lblu">C#</strong>, <strong id="grn">SQL</strong>, and <strong id="red">Swift</strong>, along with various technologies such as
                <strong>Virtual Machines &amp; Git</strong>. I am familiar with the Windows, macOS, and Linux (Ubuntu, Debian) operating systems,
                and I have experience working with remote servers on these platforms.
            </p>
            <p>
                I enjoy building backend systems, however I'm currently working towards improving my
                front-end development skills as well. I have earned numerous IT certifications, which can be viewed
                <a href="https://www.youracclaim.com/user/haden-watne" target="_blank">on my Acclaim page</a>.
