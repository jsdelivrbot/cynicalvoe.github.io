        <p>Welcome to my Portfolio! Below are some of my favorite projects, both completed and still in-progress. See
        the panels below for more information!</p>

    <div class="panel blue portfolio">
        <img src="../assets/img/portfolio/logo_icontrolu.png" alt="iControlU Logo"/>
        <p><strong>Take control of your players. Literally!</strong> iControlU is one of my most popular projects, boasting
        more than 340,000 total downloads as of 2017. Taking control of other players and using their own identities
            against them has never been easier. The latest version retails on Spigot and can be downloaded <a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/icu.20034/">on this page.</a>
            Older versions of the plugin can be found for free on Bukkit <a href="https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/icontrolu">on this page.</a></p>
    </div>

    <div class="panel portfolio">
        <img src="../assets/img/portfolio/logo_nanobots.png" alt="Nanobots Logo"/>
        <p>Nanobots is my first collaboration project, in which its concept was created by myself and a few of my friends.
            This plugin enables players to craft <strong>Nanoblocks</strong>. These dastardly creations can devour specific blocks,
            or eat through just about everything in their place. Explore Grey Goo on your server today! Nanobots can be
            downloaded for free on Spigot <a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/nanobots.28511/">here.</a></p>

    <div class="panel deepblue portfolio">
        <img src="../assets/img/portfolio/logo_thegrid.png" alt="The Grid Logo"/>
        <p>A current work-in-progress, and one of my favorite ongoing projects, is The Grid. This plugin provides a
            server-wide and open-world hacking adventure that is not only easy to install, but it is efficient and effective
            at what it does. Players can "hack" enemy NPC computers and other users to gain experience, in-game currency,
            and more. <a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/thegrid.35246/">Check it out</a> on Spigot!</p>

        <p>I hope to expand this page with more content as I release and begin new projects. I happily take suggestions,
        and - depending on my schedule - sometimes do custom plugins for server owners. Please feel free to visit my
        <a href="../contact">contact</a> page to send me an email!</p>
