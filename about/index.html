        <h1>Haden</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Haden, better known across the Internet as <strong>xFyreWolfx</strong> or <strong>FireBreath15.</strong>
            I am currently a college student studying Computer Information Systems and Business Administration.
            When I'm not studying, I spend most of my time programming, playing games, and with my friends. I have been
            working with code since I was 12 years old, and I have been in love with technology ever since.
            After moving away from my fascinations with <strong><a href="https://www.yoyogames.com/">GameMaker</a></strong>, I started learning Java for my
            new-found interest in Minecraft. I started playing around with HTML and CSS not long after, and the rest,
            as they say, is history.
        </p>
        <p>
            Today I am still invested in the Minecraft community as a Bukkit/Spigot plugin developer, as well as a
            Server Support agent at <a href="http://cubedhost.com">CubedHost, LLC.</a> I simply do what I enjoy doing,
            which has led me to pursue a career in the technology field. I hope to one day own my own technology
            business, or work for a software firm as a software engineer.
        </p>
        <p>
            When school is not in session, I enjoy spending my time working on exciting new Minecraft plugins, creating
            something new with my Raspberry Pi, reading and writing sci-fi fiction, keeping up with the latest in white-hat
            hacking, enjoying the outdoors, and spending time with friends.
