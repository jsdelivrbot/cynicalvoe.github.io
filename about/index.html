        <p class="centered ctext">
            My name is Haden, better known as <b>xFyreWolfx</b> or <b>FireBreath15</b>. I'm a college
            student studying Computer Information Systems and Business Administration. When I'm not studying,
            I spend most of my time programming, playing games, and with my friends.
            <br/>
            I have been programming since I was 12 years old, and have fallen in love with technology ever
            since. After moving away from the introductory Computer Science of <b>GameMaker</b>, I started
            learning <b>Java</b> for my new-found interest in Minecraft. I started playing around with
            <b>HTML and CSS</b> not long after, and before I knew it I had learned a total of 7 different
            languages altogether. Today I am still invested in the Minecraft community as a Bukkit/Spigot
            plugin developer, as well as a Server Support agent at CubedHost, LLC.
            <br/>
            I simply do what I enjoy doing, which has led me to pursue a career in the technology field.
            I hope to one day own my own technology business, or work for a software firm as a software engineer.
            In the meantime, I can usually be found working on one of my many projects, playing video games, providing technical
            support, and - of course - doing homework.
