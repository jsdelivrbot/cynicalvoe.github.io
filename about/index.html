        <p>My name is Haden, better known across the Internet as <strong>FireBreath15</strong>. I am currently an undergraduate
            university student studying Computer Information Systems and Business Administration in Colorado, USA. Throughout
            my college career, I have attained a number of Microsoft certifications and real-world experience in the IT
            industry, coupled with the basic knowledge of how to run a values-aligned business.
        </p>
        <p>
            My interest in the IT field began when I was 8 years old, and it quickly evolved from editing home videos to
            creating computer games and writing code. I sold my first program to a friend when I was 13, and in High School
            I developed a time-management application for a few of my friends. Beginning in 2012, I started developing Minecraft
            server mods after teaching myself Java. Some of my favorite Minecraft projects can be found on the
            <a href="../portfolio">Portfolio</a> page for more information.
        </p>
        <p>
            Today, I still spend my time in the Minecraft community as a plugin developer and Support representative at
            <a href="https://cubedhost.com/" target="_blank">CubedHost.com</a>, a server hosting company. As an
            <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality" target="_blank"><abbr title="Myers-Briggs Personality Type">INTJ</abbr></a>,
            I often spend my free time behind a keyboard, at the bookstore, or in the movie theater. When I'm not at my
            job or doing homework, I can also be found hanging out with Tinkerbell (she's my Raspberry Pi), or with friends.
        </p>
        <p>
        Thanks for taking the time to get to know me! There's a lot more I couldn't fit onto this page, but
        maybe that's a good thing. If you'd like to learn more about myself, please feel free to visit my
