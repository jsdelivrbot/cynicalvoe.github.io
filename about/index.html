            My name is Haden, better known across the Internet as <strong>xFyreWolfx</strong> or <strong>FireBreath15.</strong>
            I am currently a college student studying Computer Information Systems and Business Administration.
            When I'm not studying, I spend most of my time programming, playing games, and with my friends. I have been
            working with code since I was 12 years old, and I have been in love with technology ever since.
            After moving away from my fascinations with <strong><a href="https://www.yoyogames.com/">GameMaker</a></strong>, I started learning Java for my
            new-found interest in Minecraft. I started playing around with HTML and CSS not long after, and soon enough I had delved into
            an array of different programming languages.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Today, I spend my free time with the Minecraft community creating new Bukkit / Spigot plugins. I simply do what
            I enjoy doing, which has led me to pursue a career in the technology field. When I'm not working on
            a Minecraft project, I can be found hanging out with Tinkerbell (she's my Raspberry Pi), or with my face buried in a
            book. Currently, I work as a Server Support Specialist at <a href="https://cubedhost.com/">Cubedhost.com</a>, which
            has been a blast.
