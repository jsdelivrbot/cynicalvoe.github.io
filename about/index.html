            My name is Haden, better known across the Internet as <strong>FireBreath15</strong>. I am currently a college
            student studying <strong>Computer Information Systems</strong> and <strong>Business Administration</strong>.
            As an <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/istj-personality" target="_blank"><abbr title="Myers-Briggs Personality Type">ISTJ</abbr></a>,
            I spend my free time working on code, listening to music, reading books, watching anime, and playing games.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've been working with code since I was 12 years old, and I have been addicted ever since. Starting out with
            using <strong><a href="https://www.yoyogames.com/" target="_blank">GameMaker</a></strong>, I sold my first program to a friend
            for $0.75 when I was 13. A little annoyed that my parents wouldn't let me charge more than $1.00, I was still excited
            to create things others wanted to buy. Following this, I built a free time-management program for my friends in
            high school.
        </p>
        <p>
            It wasn't until <strong>2012</strong> that I delved into the recesses of <a href="https://minecraft.net" target="_blank">Minecraft</a> modding,
            and taught myself how to use Java. Some of my most popular and favorite projects written for Minecraft can
            be found on my <a href="../portfolio">Portfolio</a> page for more information. Today, I still spend my free time
            with the Minecraft community by writing <strong>Bukkit / Spigot plugins</strong>, and I
            love every minute of it. When I'm not working on a Minecraft project, I can be found hanging out with Tinkerbell
            (she's my Raspberry Pi), or working as a Server Support Specialist at <a href="https://cubedhost.com/" target="_blank">CubedHost.com</a>.

            <p>
                Some might say that I'm a bit of a nerd, and they're not wrong. I love being adventurous and exploring new things,
                but my favorite pastimes are best found indoors. Others might describe me as spontaneous, approachable, a bit cynical,
                witty, reserved, awkward, deliberative, and entertaining. I'm always helping classmates with homework and advice,
                and I dislike being idle for too long.
            </p>

                Thanks for taking the time to get to know me! There's a lot more I couldn't fit onto this page, but
                maybe that's a good thing. If you'd like to learn more about myself, please feel free to visit my
