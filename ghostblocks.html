		<h2>About Ghostblocks</h2>
		Welcome to Ghostblocks, where blocks are only an illusion! Ghostblocks enables players to craft and build disappearing blocks: these "Ghost blocks" look real, but disappear when players get too close. Ghost blocks are perfect for building secret bases, mob traps, hiding entrances, trolling, and more! Use them to disguise your chests and precious loot, and intruders will never know where your stash is hidden!<br>
		<br>
		<h2>Using Ghostblocks</h2>
		To install Ghostblocks, simply drag the downloaded file "Ghostblocks.jar" into your server's <b>/plugins</b> folder and restart the server. Crafting Ghostblocks is simple: by harnessing the power of Ghast Tears and precious metals, players can craft Ghostdrops which can be applied to any block in Minecraft. To craft a Ghostdrop, simply surround a Ghast Tear with either Iron or Gold Ingots in a Crafting Table. Ghostblocks appear to every online player, however they disappear when players get too close. They may also disappear when clicked. Ghostblocks do not modify your world in any way, and will not exist if the plugin is uninstalled. They are illusions.
