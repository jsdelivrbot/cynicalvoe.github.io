Congratulations,
You have been selected by ウルフ to participate in an exciting adventure of website hacking and information gathering. This site is dedicated to finding skilled computer users who know a thing or two about the Internet, all the while providing some good old-fashioned hacking practice. This is a student-made and student-hosted website, so expect frequent downtime and maintenance.

Your job is to go through the website and find all the hidden treasures. Id call them easter eggs, but youre supposed to find them. Anyway, you will need to use all your knowledge about websites to successfully crack the puzzle. If you do your job successfully, you will be notified by the website and will be allowed to continue.

Most pages on this site are protected by browser cookies and JavaScript, meaning you cant cheat your way through the game. Remember, all code and text you see has been made especially for that purpose, so take advantage of reading what is on your screen. If you take the red pill and play this game, I will show you just how far this rabbit hole goes.

I look forward to hacking with you.
