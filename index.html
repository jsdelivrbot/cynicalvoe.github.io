        <h3>About This Site's Design</h3>
        <p>I have been playing Minecraft since early 2012. As such, Minecraft has provided me with opportunities to
            practice my love for software within the plugin development scope. This website is dedicated to my current
            skills as a developer, and for its theme I decided to choose the game that helped me get started.</p>
