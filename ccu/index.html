<h1>Class Registration Button Hack</h1>
<p>In order to use the script, you will need a browser addon. For Firefox, use
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/">Greasemonkey<a> and for Chrome, use
<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo">Tampermonkey</a>.</p>
<p>After installing, click the following link to download the button hack:</p>
<a href="script.js"><h1>script.js</h1></a>
<p>Finally, you will need to add the script to your browser's new extension. In the new icon that appears in your browser's
toolbar, click the link to add a new user-script. In the page that opens, paste the contents of the script
you downloaded above, then CTRL + S to save.</p>
<p>You did it! Now, all you need to do to hack the register button is to press the SHIFT key on your keyboard. The button will turn
bright green when you know it's ready to use. The button still won't work until you are allowed to register, but this eliminates
the need to refresh the page before registering.</p>
