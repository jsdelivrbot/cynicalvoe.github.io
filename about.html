		<br>
		I (xFyreWolfx, FireBreath15) am a college student currently studying Computer Information Systems. When I'm not doing homework, I'm 
		creating software for Minecraft, myself, and my friends. In doing so, most of what I make ends up on the Internet as a result. I love
		to make fun, useful, or random programs, and I love to see others using them.
		<br>
		I started programming when I was about 12 years old, in the form of GameMaker Language (GML). It served its purpose until I was about 14, 
		when I discovered Minecraft. Since then, Java has been my primary language. Currently, I am in the process of learning Apple's Swift language
		to develop iOS applications.
		<br>
		When I'm not hacking on things or writing pieces of code, I enjoy spending time outdoors, hanging out with friends, and playing video games. 
		Oh, and yes - I have a job as well. I currently work at <b><a href="cubedhost.com">CubedHost, LLC</a></b> part-time as a Minecraft Server
		Support Specialist. 
		<br>
		You *may* have noticed the symbol of the Republic/Empire/First Order floating around the site. As the answer to a very random question, <b>'Dark Side or Light Side?'</b>,
		I chose the Dark Side. Just a fun fact. You should join us, we have cookies.
		<br>
		Many people ask me why I chose the username xFyreWolfx. Honestly, my usernames change quite often. Another random fact about me is that I consider
		my personality similar to one of a wolf, and being that my previous username was FireBreath15 I thought I'd combine the two.
		<br>
		<br>
		Thanks for taking the time to read my rather odd biography.
		<br>
		<br>
		Sincerely,
		<br>
		~xFyreWolfx
