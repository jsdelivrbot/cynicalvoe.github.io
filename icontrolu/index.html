        <h1>What is iControlU?</h1>
        <hr/>
        <p>Calling all Minecraft server owners! If you run a Spigot-based Minecraft server, and are looking to add a new layer of
        fun, iControlU is the plugin for you! This plugin allows server owners to temporarily control the actions of other players,
        making server trolling even more hilarious. If you're not one for player trolling, iControlU can also be used to show
        other players around the server, provide tutorials and help to new users, and more.</p>
        <p>You may have heard of this plugin from popular YouTubers such as <strong>ZexyZek</strong>, <strong>RGA Gaming</strong>,
            <strong>TycerX</strong>, <strong>Failboat</strong>, and others. Not only is it a fun extension to any Minecraft
        server, but it is easy to use and can be installed in a matter of seconds.</p>
        <p>The plugin is highly configurable, lightweight, and comes with free technical support over on SpigotMC.org. If you
        are interested in the plugin, you can find download information below!</p>
